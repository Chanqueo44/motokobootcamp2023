    5.What is wrong with the following code?
        actor {
        var languages : [var Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

        public func show_languages(language : Text) : async [var Text] {
            return (languages);
        };
        
        }
    Answer:The function should not return a mutable array. The array we return should be immutable  and we should remove the "var" from the return type.
    6.What is wrong with the following code?
        actor {
        var languages : [Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

        public func add_language(new_language: Text) : async [Text] {
            languages := Array.append<Text>(languages, [new_language]);
            return (languages);
        };
        
        }
     Answer: We should use a Buffer instead of an Array, since the append function is deprecated
